When you change API routes or controllers, update the Postman collection file `postman/go-fiber-template.postman_collection.json` so it reflects all available endpoints. Include example request bodies for create and update operations when relevant.
Always run `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...` after making changes and report the results.
